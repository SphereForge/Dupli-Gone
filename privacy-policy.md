# Privacy Policy for Dupli-Gone

**Last Updated: November 19, 2025**

Thank you for using Dupli-Gone. Your privacy is important. This privacy policy explains how information is handled in my application, Dupli-Gone.

### 1. About Dupli-Gone's Monetization Model

*   **Free Version:** The App is free to download and use. This version is supported by third-party advertising.
*   **Pro Upgrade (In-App Purchase):** Users can choose to make a one-time in-app purchase to upgrade to the "Pro" version. This upgrade removes all advertising and permanently unlocks all premium features in the App.

### 2. Core App Functionality (Local Processing)

Dupli-Gone is designed to function entirely on your device. The application does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal media files (photos, videos, etc.). All file scanning and processing performed by the App happens locally on your phone. Your files are never uploaded to any server or seen by me.

### 3. Data Handling (Advertising)

To support the App and keep it free, I integrate third-party services into the free version of Dupli-Gone.

My advertising partners are:

*   Unity LevelPlay (Mediation)
*   Unity Ads
*   ironSource (part of Unity)
*   Google AdMob

With your consent, these services may collect and process certain data from your device to provide personalized and relevant advertising. I do not access, store, or manage this data directly. This data may include:

*   **Device Identifiers:** Such as your Android Advertising ID (GAID).
*   **General Location Data:** Non-precise location, such as country or city.
*   **Technical Information:** Information about your device, such as device model, operating system version, and mobile network information.
*   **Ad Engagement Data:** Information about the ads you have seen and interacted with.

Declining consent for personalized ads will not stop ads from being shown, but they will be generic and may be less relevant to your interests.

### 4. How This Data Is Used

The information collected by my partners is used by them for the following purposes:

*   **To Monetize the App:** Displaying ads allows me to offer Dupli-Gone to you for free.
*   **To Personalize Advertising:** To show ads that are more relevant to you (with your consent).
*   **For Analytics and Reporting:** To measure ad performance and understand how users interact with ads.

### 5. Log Data and Crash Reports

To improve the stability and performance of Dupli-Gone, I rely on standard, anonymous diagnostic services.

*   **Google Play:** If the app crashes, your Android operating system may automatically generate a report that is sent to my Google Play Console. This data is purely technical and helps me fix bugs related to the Android OS. This is controlled by a system-wide setting on your device, typically under **Settings > Google > Usage & diagnostics**.

*   **Unity:** To provide advertising services, the Unity SDK integrated in this app also collects "Essential Data." This is anonymous diagnostic and technical data required to ensure their services function correctly, to detect errors, and to prevent fraud. I have disabled all non-essential data collection and usage in my Unity project settings.

Both of these services collect anonymous data only, such as device model, OS version, and the specific code that caused an error. This data contains no personal information and is used solely for the purpose of identifying and fixing bugs to improve your app experience.

### 6. Your Consent Choices

On the first launch of the App, you will be presented with a consent dialog powered by Google's User Messaging Platform. This dialog gives you the choice to either consent or decline the collection and use of your data for personalized advertising. You can change this choice at any time from within the app by clicking on the privacy icon on the main menu.

### 7. In-App Purchase (Pro Upgrade)

If you choose to upgrade to the Pro version via the in-app purchase, the App will stop requesting and displaying all advertisements. Consequently, data collection for advertising purposes by my partners will cease. All payments are processed securely by the Google Play Store. I do not collect, see, or store any of your financial information. The App simply verifies the purchase with Google Play to confirm your Pro status.

### 8. Data Security & Third-Party Policies

As the core functionality of Dupli-Gone does not collect your data, I rely on the robust security measures of my advertising partners to protect the information they collect. You are strongly encouraged to review their privacy policies for more details:

*   **Unity (for Unity Ads & LevelPlay):** https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy
*   **ironSource:** https://developers.is.com/ironsource-mobile/air/ironsource-mobile-privacy-policy/
*   **Google (for AdMob & Play Services):** https://policies.google.com/privacy


### 9. Children's Privacy

This app is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). I do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If a parent or guardian believes that data has been collected for personalized ads without their consent, they can **delete** the device's Advertising ID to prevent further data collection. This option is typically found in the device's main **Settings app > Google > Ads**.

### 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

**Last Updated:** November 2, 2025

Thank you for using Dupli-Gone. Your privacy is important. This privacy policy explains how information is handled in my application, Dupli-Gone.

**About Dupli-Gone's Monetization Model:**

*   **Free Version:** The App is free to download and use. This version is supported by third-party advertising.
*   **Pro Upgrade (In-App Purchase):** Users can choose to make a one-time in-app purchase to upgrade to the "Pro" version. This upgrade removes all advertising from the App.

**1. Core App Functionality**
Dupli-Gone is designed to function entirely on your device. The application does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal media files (photos, videos, etc.). All file scanning and processing performed by the App happens locally on your phone. Your files are never uploaded to any server or seen by me.

**2. Data Handling (Advertising)**
To support the App and keep it free, I integrate third-party advertising services into the free version of Dupli-Gone.

My advertising partners are:
*   **Unity LevelPlay (Mediation)**
*   **Unity Ads**
*   **ironSource (part of Unity)**

Additionally, I use **Google AdMob's** services solely for the purpose of managing and displaying the user consent form for advertising.

With your consent, these services may collect and process certain data from your device to provide personalized and relevant advertising. I do not access, store, or manage this data directly. This data may include:

*   **Device Identifiers:** Such as your Android Advertising ID (GAID).
*   **General Location Data:** Non-precise location, such as country or city, may be inferred from your IP address.
*   **Technical Information:** Information about your device, such as device model, operating system version, and mobile network information.
*   **Ad Engagement Data:** Information about the ads you have seen and interacted with.

This data is used by the advertising partners to serve ads that are more likely to be of interest to you and to help them measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. Declining consent will not stop ads from being shown, but they may be less relevant to your interests.

**3. How Advertising Data Is Used**
The information collected by the advertising partners is used by them for the following purposes:

*   To monetize the App: Displaying ads allows me to offer Dupli-Gone to you for free.
*   To Personalize Advertising: To show ads that are more relevant to you.
*   For Analytics and Reporting: To measure ad performance and understand how users interact with ads.

**4. Your Consent Choices**
On the first launch of the App, you will be presented with a consent dialog. This dialog gives you the choice to either accept or decline the collection and use of your data for personalized advertising. You can change this choice at any time from within the app's settings.

**5. In-App Purchase (Pro Upgrade)**
If you choose to upgrade to the Pro version via the in-app purchase, the App will stop requesting and displaying all advertisements. Consequently, the data collection for advertising purposes by my partners will cease.

All payments are processed securely by Google Play. I do not collect, see, or store your financial information. The App verifies the purchase through Google Play's services to confirm your entitlement to the Pro features and to disable advertising.

**6. Data Security**
As stated, the core functionality of Dupli-Gone does not collect or store your data. For the data collected by advertising partners in the free version, I rely on their respective security measures to protect the information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access.

You are encouraged to review their privacy policies for more details on their security practices:

*   **Unity (for Unity Ads, ironSource & LevelPlay):** https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy
*   **Google (for AdMob Consent & Ad Services):** https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads

**7. Children's Privacy**
This app is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). I do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If advertising partners collect data in the free version, it is done in accordance with their policies regarding children's privacy.

If a parent or guardian believes that their child has provided data for personalized ads without their consent, they can prevent further use of this data by managing the device's Advertising ID. This option is typically found in the device's main Settings app, under the Google section, within the Ads menu.

**8. Changes to This Privacy Policy**
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

**9. Contact & Bug Reports**
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to report a bug, please do not hesitate to create an issue on the official GitHub repository: **[https://github.com/SphereForge/Dupli-Gone/issues]**

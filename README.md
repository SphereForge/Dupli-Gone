### About Dupli-Gone

Is your phone's storage always full? Dupli-Gone is a simple, powerful, and private cleanup utility for your media library.

It's a duplicate file finder that scans your phone for both exact duplicates and visually similar photos and videos. It then groups them together, making it easy to review and delete unwanted files to free up valuable space on your device.

### ✨ Key Features

*   **PRIVACY FIRST: ALL SCANS ARE OFFLINE**
    *   All processing of your photos and videos happens directly on your device. Your files are never uploaded to any server and remain completely private.

*   **DUAL SCAN MODES FOR A DEEPER CLEAN**
    *   **Find Duplicates:** A fast scan to find and remove identical files.
    *   **Find Similar:** A powerful scan to catch visually similar photos (like burst shots or multiple takes of the same scene).

*   **SMART GROUPING & SELECTION**
    *   Results are presented in easy-to-review groups. To protect your best shots, the app automatically marks the "Original" file to keep based on a combination of the oldest date and the highest resolution.

*   **FULL CONTROL**
    *   Easily select or deselect entire groups or individual files for deletion. The intuitive interface makes the cleanup process fast and simple.

### 💎 Premium Features (Free & Pro)

*   **Scan Specific Folders:** Target cleanup to chosen folders for a quick, focused scan.
*   **Ignore Lists:** Permanently exclude specific groups or entire folders from future scans.
